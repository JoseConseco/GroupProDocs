Then, inside Blender, go to: Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons, and click ' Install ' button. And navigate to GroupPro_2.x.zip (for Blender 2.8) file location. Updating \u00b6 GroupPro has build in auto updater. When you use it, updater will download latest GroupPro release and install in background. To use auto updater go to: Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> GroupPro -> press 'Check for update'. In new version is found, press ' Update addon ' button, wait few seconds for download, installation and restart blender. Or you download update manually by getting new zip file from your Gumroad account. You should have received download link to zip file, with email when you purchased GroupPro. Location \u00b6 GroupPro pie menu: ' Ctrl+X ' hotkey (can be changed in addon preferences). Addon panel location: 3D View, right Sidebar(N): \"GroupPro\" tab (tab also can be changed in preferences). Support \u00b6 For support or bug reports use this discord server . Note -Do no use group offset feature, form group panel. Group offset is used by script for calculating data, and it should be never edited by hand. If you do so, group offset will be calculated in wrong way, which will result in incorrect display of group instances.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#grouppro-documentation","text":"GroupPro was made because default blender group instances are powerful, but they are not user friendly to work with.

You will notice selected objects are now merged into one group, and cannot be selected individually. To edit group components you have to open it with 'Edit Group' button. After pressing it you will see green box around edited group (color depend on your settings in addon preferences). Any modifications performed on object that are member of group, will be saved after you press 'Close Group' button. You can add or remove objects from group, while you have group opened, using Add/Remove from group buttons. Note: If you remove all objects from group, while editing it, group will be deleted after pressing 'Close Group' button. Create Group \u00b6 Joins selected objects together into collection instance Joins selected objects in one, and creating CollectionInstance from them. After using this function you can press F9 to change group name or change group pivot location (median point or 3d cursor location). Edit Group \u00b6 You can perform modifications to CollectionInstance, add/remove objects from it, after pressing this button. You will notice green box around objects that are members of group. Also in bottom left corner, there will be info with name of currently edited group name. NOTE : Color of edited group can be customized in addon preferences -> View Tab. You can set it to be completely transparent if you want. Add/Remove from Group \u00b6 Add/Remove from Group \u2013 while you are in edit group mode you can press those buttons to add/remove selected objects from/to group. Changes will be saved after Close Group. Close Group \u00b6 After editing group merges objects back together Saves changes performed while you were in edit group mode, merges objects back together. Dissolve \u00b6 Split Group of objects into separate components Very similar to build in blender operator \u201cmake duplicates real (shift+ctrl+A)\u201d. It splits Grouped object into separate, individual mesh objects. MaxDepth - parameter describes how many subgroups, from selected objects will be split. For example setting it to 1 - will split only main group, but not sub-groups. Initialize groups \u00b6 Initialize groups \u2013 when you copy CollectionInstance from one blend file to another (using ctrl+c, ctrl+v), you may noticed pasted Group is messy - all objects, that the CollectionInstance is made of, are visible. To cleanup scene after pasting new Group into scene, select all the objects and press 'Initialize groups'. I will hide all unnecessary objects leaving only relevant Collection Instances. Set group origin \u00b6 Change origin of selected group instance, while maintaining position of other instances Changes pivot point of selected CollectionInstance, while preserving position all other instances. This works only on active object. 3d cursor Objects Center Bounding Box Bottom Bounding box center Delete Group \u00b6 Removes group and all its instances permanently from scene Deletes group with subgroups and objects that this group is made of permanently from blender file. After using this operation you won't have access to deleted Group. In contrast using 'delete' key on keyboard, deletes group from scene, but you can still access and add back group from: Shift+A \u2192 'Collection instances\u201d menu. Pick Group \u00b6 Quickly open nested sub collection with Pick Group If you have made group from sub groups, which have sub-groups, opening those nested sub-sub-groups may be time consuming. Pick group will let you open group which is directly under cursor, no matter how much nested it is inside parent groups. CleanUP \u00b6 Cleanup unused groups - groups that are currently not being linked to scene. Useful when there are lots of Collection Instances under \u201cShift+A\u201d -> Collection Instances, and you are not using them. This command will delete groups only if they are not used on scene. Flip selection \u00b6 clones and mirrors object around chosen axis. After using this function you can press F9, to change axis of mirroring, pivot point (scene center, or 3d cursor), or disable duplication. This button was developed, because creating mirrored group instance is buggy, so I created 'Flip selection' button. Make unique \u00b6 Makes selected Group separate instance. Use it when you want to customize look of one Group, without affecting look of other instances that are already on scene. maxDepth - Maximum depth for which unique groups will be created. 0-inifinite depth, default=1 De-instance meshes - do you want new collection instance objects to be instanced or copies De-instance materials - do you want new collection instance materials to be instanced or copies Note : When you use Shift+D hotkey, to copy group - i will be un-instanced from original group automatically.","title":"Operations"},{"location":"main_functions/#usage","text":"To create new group select objects you want to join, and press Ctrl+X -> 'Create Group'.
